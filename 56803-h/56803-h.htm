<h2 id="Ref_5" class="no-break">PREFACE.</h2>


<p class="dropcap">The honour of performing several
physical amusements before
their Britannic Majesties and the
Royal Family, was an event that
flattered my ambition in the highest
degree. To obtain their suffrages,
and those of that part of this enlightened
nation, before which I have repeated
the same experiments and amusements
at the Theatre Royal, Hay-Market,
was the summit of my wishes.
Having obtained these two desirable
ends, I blessed the moments I
had devoted to the study of natural
philosophy and mathematics; to them
I am indebted for these inestimable
advantages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>Some invidious hints insinuated
relative to the means I practised
for performing these several experiments
came to trouble the happiness
I enjoyed. The opportunities
I had of demonstrating publicly the
simplicity and fairness of the execution
of my experiments, which had
appeared complicated to such a degree
as to require a confederate, have put
me in the happy way of destroying
those unfavourable impressions, and
of undeceiving those persons who honoured
me with their presence; their
repeated applauses have been a very
flattering testimony of their approbation
of my endeavours to amuse the
public.</p>

<p>Several persons of the first rank
having signified their wishes that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
would publish some few easy means
of amusing a company, whether in
town or in the country; I could not
refuse to comply with their desire:
this is the motive of this little publication.
Being near my departure
for France, I shall trace hastily a
few experiments, which will be as
simple as they are entertaining, and
easy to be performed. If amongst
them there should be found, by chance,
some that are known, or even printed,
I hope it will not be taken amiss,
nor I shall be looked upon as a
plagiary. Unacquainted with this
town, I cannot be informed of all
that exists in print: besides, as in
this age the study of natural philosophy
is so universal, it cannot be in
the least astonishing if some of the
experiments resulting from that science<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
were already known. Therefore I
claim by anticipation the indulgence
of those who read this work.
My only wish is to be so happy as
to unite in this book the clearness
and precision necessary to enable my
readers to perform what is contained
in each chapter. My project on my
return to this metropolis, is to endeavour
to obtain again the suffrages of
the nation, by performing some new
experiments. To reveal on this occasion
those which I have performed
till now, would be hurtful to my fortune:
besides, most of them require
a great deal of mechanism and great
preparations. Others depend on much
dexterity and subtilty; which are
out of my power to give, and out
of a possibility to be communicated
in writing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>If this feeble Essay, which I have
the honour of presenting to the public,
is favourably received, I promise
on my return, and after I have merited
their favour, to publish the
means I have used to execute all I
have performed.</p>

<p class="chapdesc"><em>Curious Method of restoring to Life, in two Minutes,
a Fly that has been drowned even
twenty-four Hours.</em></p>

<p class="dropcap">This wonderful experiment, like many
others, is produced by a very simple cause.
Take a fly, put it in a glass or cup full
of water; cover it so as to deprive the fly
of air; when you perceive it to be quite
motionless, you may take it out and put it
on a place exposed to the sun, and cover it
with salt: in two minutes it will revive and
fly away.</p>

<h2 id="Ref_12">CHAP. II.</h2>


<p class="chapdesc"><em>To make a Colour that will appear or disappear
by Means of the Air.</em></p>

<p class="dropcap">Take a smelling-bottle; put in it some
alkali volatile, in which you have dissolved
some copper filings: this will produce
a blue colour. Present then the
smelling-bottle to one of the company, desiring
him to stop it; and, to their great
astonishment, the colour will disappear as
soon as the smelling-bottle is stopped: you
will make it easily re-appear by taking off
the cork, which will be not less surprising.</p>

will appear well proportioned from a certain
Point of View.</em></p>

<p class="dropcap">Draw any thing you may fancy on
a thin white pasteboard; then prick it;
afterwards put the same on an horizontal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
surface, which we will suppose to be another
pasteboard. Put a lighted candle behind
that drawing, and draw on the horizontal
surface the lines given by the light: this
will give a deformed design. This being
done, take away the drawing that was pricked
and the candle; then place your eye where
the light was, and you will see your drawing
assume a regular form.</p>

<p class="chapdesc"><em>To change the Colour of a Rose.</em></p>

<p class="dropcap">Nothing more is wanting to change
the colour of a rose, whether it is on its
stalk or not, but to burn some sulphur under
it; which will make it turn white, and
it will not regain its primitive colour in less
than two hours.</p>

<p class="chapdesc"><em>To render hideous the Faces of all the
Company.</em></p>

<p class="dropcap">Dissolve some salt and saffron in some
spirits of wine; dip a little tow in it
and set fire to it. At this light, those who
are of a fair complexion will appear green,
and the red of the lips and cheeks turn to
a deep olive colour.</p>

<h2 id="Ref_14a">CHAP. VI.</h2>


<p class="chapdesc"><em>Method of Engraving in Relief on the Shell
of a new-laid Egg.</em></p>

<p class="dropcap">Chuse an egg that has a thick shell;
wash it well in fresh water; then dry it
very carefully with a linen cloth; this being
done, put some tallow or fat in a silver spoon;
then hold it on the fire; when the fat is
melted and very hot, it will serve instead of
ink for drawing with a new pen whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
you like. This being finished, you are to
take the egg by the two ends between two
fingers, and then lay it gently in a tumbler
filled with good white wine vinegar; wherein,
after remaining for three hours and an half,
the acid of the vinegar will have eaten enough
of the thickness of the shell; and as it cannot
have the same effect on those places that
are covered with the fat, all the drawing
will have preserved its thickness, and will
form the relief that is wanted, the operation
sought for.</p>

<p>By this means one may draw on an egg a
coat of arms, a mosaic piece, medallion, or
any other design whatever.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Load your gun with the usual charge
of powder, but instead of shot put half
a charge of quicksilver; prime and shoot: if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
your piece bears ever so little near the bird, as
it is not necessary to touch it, the swallow will
find itself stunned and benumbed to such a
degree, as to fall to the ground in a fit. As
it will regain its senses in a few minutes,
you may make use of the time by saying, that
you are going to bring it to life again; this
will astonish greatly the company; the ladies
will no doubt interest themselves in favour
of the bird, and intercede for its liberty:
sympathizing with their feelings for the
little prisoner, may be the means of some
of them sympathizing with yours.</p>

<p class="chapdesc"><em>To make a Calve’s Head bellow as if alive, when
dressed and served up.</em></p>

<p class="dropcap">This is effected by a simple and innocent
stratagem; it consists in what follows:
take a frog that is alive, and put
it at the farther end of the calve’s head,
under the tongue, which you will let fall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
over it; taking care not to put the frog
there till the calve’s head is going to be
served up.</p>

<p>The heat of the tongue will make the
frog croak; which sound, coming from the
hollow part of the head, will imitate the bellowing
of a calf as if it were alive.</p>

<h2 id="Ref_17">CHAP. IX.</h2>


<p class="chapdesc"><em>A puzzling Question to be proposed for Solution.</em></p>

<p class="dropcap">Set down three sums on paper; and
say to the company, ladies and gentlemen,
there are three sums, very different from
each other, and very disproportionate; yet I
wish to divide them among three persons,
so that they may have an equal sum each,
and yet without altering any thing in either
of the sums. This will appear very
difficult, yet nothing so simple and easy;
one single addition will suffice to prove to
you that the amount of each sum will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the same, and that the shares will not enrich
much the respective persons: here is
the proof:</p>


<h3>EXAMPLE.</h3>

<div class="boxnum center">
<p class="alignright">5134122<br />
  61254<br />
   7218</p>
</div>


<h3>OPERATION.</h3>

<p>Cast up the first of these sums in the following
manner, and say, 5 and 1 make 6;
3 more, 9; 4 more, 13; 1 more, 14; 2
more, 16; and 2 more, 18: set down――18.</p>

<p>Make the addition of the second sum in
the same manner as you have done the first,
and you will find the same sum of――18.</p>

<p>Then proceed for the third as in the two
preceding, and the product will be also――18.</p>

<p>Here then is my division made, and each
person will have only 18, as I have proved
by the foregoing example.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>By this we see, that nothing more is required
than to be attentive in setting the
sums, to make the numbers so that each
sum may amount only to 18.</p>

<p>You may make the same question on whatever
sum you please, only observing, as
above, that the amount of the numbers you
set may not exceed the sum you desire to belong
to each person that is to have a share.</p>

<h2 id="Ref_19">CHAP. X.</h2>


<p class="chapdesc"><em>How to dispose two little Figures, so that
one shall light a Candle, and the other put
it out.</em></p>

<p class="dropcap">Take two little figures of wood or
clay, or any other materials you please,
only taking care that there is a little hole at
the mouth of each. Put in the mouth
of one a few grains of bruised gunpowder,
and a little bit of phosphorus in the
mouth of the other; taking care that these
preparations are made before hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Then take a lighted wax candle and present
it to the mouth of the figure with the gunpowder,
which taking fire will put the candle
out: then present your candle, having
the snuff still hot, to the other figure; it
will light again immediately, by means of
the phosphorus.</p>

<p>You may propose the same effect to be
produced by two figures drawn on a wall
with a pencil or coal, by applying, with a
little starch or water, a few grains of bruised
gunpowder to the mouth of one, and a bit
of phosphorus to the mouth of the other.</p>

the other of hearts; then put on that
of spades the marks of hearts, and on that
of hearts, those of spades; which you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
do easily, by splitting a card of each colour,
which you are to cut out with dexterity,
in order that the mark may be
very neat: then rub lightly on the back of
the spades and hearts that you have cut, a
little soap, or very white pomatum; then
put the mark of hearts on the ace of
spades, and the mark of spades on the ace
of hearts; taking care to cover them quite
hermetically, and to make all your preparations
before you begin your experiments.</p>

<p>Divide your pack of cards in two parcels,
and under each parcel you must put one of
your two aces thus prepared; afterwards,
take with your right hand the parcel under
which is the ace of hearts, and with your
left that where the ace of spades.</p>

<p>You will then shew to the company that
the ace of hearts is on the right hand,

every body is convinced of it, you are
to say, ladies and gentlemen, I am going
to command the ace of hearts, which is
in my right hand, to pass to my left, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the ace of spades to take its place; you
may even propose to have both your arms
tied, to prevent their joining and communicating.</p>

<p>All the secret consists only in making a
movement and stamping of your foot, when
you give your command: during this movement
and stamping of your foot, you must slip
with dexterity your little finger on each of
the marks, in order to rub off and make the
marks of spades and hearts, that were sticking
on the two cards by the means explained
before, fall, without any body perceiving it;
then you will shew to the company that the
cards have obeyed your command, by passing
from the left to the right, and from
the right to the left, without your hands
communicating.</p>

<p>This trick, done with dexterity and subtilty,
will appear very singular, although it
is very simple.</p>

by any body, by writing before hand on a Paper
or Card a Number, which will certainly
be that of the Card that has been thought of.</em></p>

<p class="dropcap">All the preparation of this trick consists
in a mathematical combination; here
follows the method of operating in order to
succeed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Take a pack of piquet cards, present them
to one of the company, desiring him to
shuffle them well, and to get them shuffled
by whoever he pleases: then make several
persons cut them. After which you will
propose to one of the company to take the
pack, and think of a card, and remember
it, as likewise of the number of its order in
the pack, by counting one, two, three, four, &amp;c.
till he comes inclusively to the card thought
of by him. Then offer to go in another room
while he is doing what you required, or to
be blind-folded, assuring the company that
you will declare before-hand, if required,
the number of the order in which the card
is that has been thought of.</p>


<h3>EXAMPLE.</h3>

<p>In the supposition that the person who
thinks of the card will stop at number
13, and that thirteenth card is the queen
of hearts.</p>

<p>Supposing again that the number you have
marked or designed before-hand is number
24; you will return in the room in case you
had left it; or desire the handkerchief, to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
taken off, if you have been blind-folded; and,
without asking any question of the person
who has thought of the card, ask only for
the pack, and apply it to your nose as if
to smell it; then passing it behind your
back, or under the table, you must take,
beginning from the bottom of the pack,
twenty-three cards, that is to say, one less
than the number you had designed before
hand; then place those twenty-three cards
on the top of the remainder; you must take
particular care not to put one more or less,
for that would prevent your success. This
being done, you are to return the pack to
the person who has thought of the card,
recommending him to reckon the cards
from the top of the pack, beginning by
the number of the card he thought of. His
card being the thirteenth, he will be obliged
to count fourteen, and you are to flop him
when he comes to twenty three, telling
him that the number you have designed is
twenty-four, and that consequently the twenty-fourth
card which he is going to take up will
be the queen of hearts, and it will be exactly
the case.</p>

<p>In the supposition then that this eighth
parcel begins by a ten, or court card,
which is the same, there would remain no
cards, and you would have eight parcels.</p>

<p>If it began by any other card, not adapted
to make out thirteen, there would remain
four cards, which must be spread on
the table, without discovering them.</p>

<p>In order to find out the number of points
contained under each of the parcels, whether
they be to the amount of eight, or only seven,
and four cards remaining, you must make
use of the following method:</p>

<p>Without touching the cards, separate in
your mind four parcels; then multiply silently
by 14 the remaining parcels, whether
they are four or only three.</p>

<p>In the first case you are to say in your
mind, 4 times 14 are 56, then add to this
number one point for each of the parcels that
you have separated in your mind, which will
make 60. Then make the eight parcels be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
turned up, and count the number of points
contained in each of the cards that are under,
you will then find 60, observing that the
aces count only for one point, and the court
cards for 10.</p>

<p>If there should be only 7 parcels, you will
have 4 cards remaining; you will however
separate 4 in your mind; then you are to
multiply the 3 remaining parcels by 14; and
say to yourself, 3 times 14 is 42, and 4 for
the 4 parcels that you separated, make 46;
to which you must add 4 more for the 4
cards that will remain, which will make 50.
On turning up the 7 parcels you will necessarily
find 50.</p>

<p>If by chance each parcel should begin by
an ace, which is possible, you could then
make only 4 parcels, and as it must be the
4 aces, that would be found under, you
would only have 4 points.</p>

<p>If it happened also, that three parcels began
each by an ace, it would then take up 39
cards; it is probable that in such a case there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
would be only four parcels in all, and a few
cards remaining: you must then content
yourself with counting as many points as
parcels; to which you will add one point
for each of the remaining cards, and this
will amount infallibly to the just number
of the points of the cards under the four
parcels.</p>

shew him your paper on which is written

the phosphorus with your fingers; but take
the point of a knife, or a pair of small pincers.

of Blood.</em></p>

<p class="dropcap">This liquor or fluid furnishes the entertaining
means of making known to a company
the person who is most addicted to love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>


<h3><em>Preparation of the Liquor.</em></h3>

<p>Cut in very small chips a piece of Fernambuco
wood; put them in a large glass full
of good white wine vinegar; add to it a bit
of common white allum, of the size of a
small nut; make the whole simmer over a
gentle fire for half an hour, in a new earthen
pot or pipkin; taking care to stir this composition,
in order to prevent it from boiling
over while on the fire.</p>

<p>When it is taken from the fire, let it
cool, and strain it through a piece of linen;
then pour it into a bottle of clear glass.</p>

<p>You must make all these preparations before-hand;
as these experiments are only
agreeable when performed with quickness.</p>

<p>You will find it necessary to provide yourself
with a tube of clear glass, about fifteen
or eighteen inches long, about the thickness
of a wax candle, taking care to have it stopt
at one end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>When you present yourself before a company,
in order to perform this experiment,
you are to carry the tube in your pocket,
and holding the phial in your hand, you are
to say, “Ladies and gentlemen, here is a
phial containing liquid blood; I hope to
make you know by it the person most
addicted to love in the company.</p>

<p>“Please to observe that I pour a little of
this liquor in this tube. As you might
imagine that this liquor, like that put in
thermometers, may rise by dilating itself
when exposed to heat, and consequently
the pressure of the hand will suffice to
produce this effect, and it will condense
by rarifying when exposed to cold; I assure
you, ladies and gentlemen, it is not the
case; this liquor differs entirely from that
put in thermometers; and you may easily
be convinced of it before I make the experiment
I promised you. You may put
it near the heat of a candle, and even that
of a fire, without any degree of heat making
it rise in the least; but by a peculiar
and sympathetic virtue you will see it boil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
when the tube is touched by a person of
an amorous disposition.”</p>

<p>Then take out of your pocket a little potash,
keep it in the interior part of the hand
that holds the tube at the top, as if you
wanted to keep it shut, and as soon as the
person you wish to make pass for the most
amorous in the company takes the lowest
part of the tube in his hand, you are to let
fall dexterously a little of the potash in it,
and you will see the liquor boil and rise to
the top of the tube, to the great astonishment
of the spectators.</p>

multiply, by whatever number he pleases, one
of the three sums which you will give him on
a piece of paper; desire him to strike out
whatever figure he pleases of the product of
his multiplication, let him change and invert
the order of the remaining figures after the
defalcation he has chosen.</p>

<p>While the person is making his calculation
and the subsequent operations, go in

return, desire the person who has done the
multiplication, to give you the remaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
product on a piece of paper or card; put it
to your nose as though you would smell it;
then you will tell him, to the great astonishment
of the whole Company, what figure
he had struck out.</p>

<p>In order to do this operation, first observe,
that the figures composing each of the three
sums you propose to be multiplied, do not
exceed the number of 18.</p>


<h3>EXAMPLE.</h3>

<p>Suppose the three sums proposed to be the
following:</p>

<div class="p1">
<div id="Ref_60" class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i060.jpg" width="300" height="242" alt="" />

<tr><td class="para1">The product will then be</td><td class="number">926478</td></tr>
<tr><td class="para1"></td><td class="number1">――――</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Suppose likewise that the figure which has
been struck out is the 6, the remaining ones
will form a sum of 92,478.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>As you let the person who has done the
multiplication set down the figures in the order
he pleases, suppose also that he sets them
down thus, on the piece of paper he gives you,</p>

<p class="center">79,482.</p>

<p>When you pretend to smell the paper,
add together in your mind the figures presented
to you, in order to reduce them to
nines; and say in your mind 7 and 2 make
nine; after that 8 and 4 make 12; in 12
there is 9, and three remains towards 9 more;
to complete which 6 is wanting, which is
and must be the figure struck out. This calculation
must be made quickly, and while
you pass the paper under your nose under the
pretext of smelling it.</p>

<p>There is another manner of proceeding
to guess the figure left out, by letting the
person chuse the sum he pleases to be multiplied,
but then you must ask him to shew
you the sum he means to have multiplied,
and to let you add one figure at your option.</p>

<p>In that case, by running your eyes over
the sum set down, you will easily see what
figure you are obliged to add in order to complete
the number of 9.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>


<h3>EXAMPLE.</h3>

<p>In the supposition that the sum set down
is the following:</p>

<p class="center">789,788</p>

<p>Add in your mind thus: 7 and 8 are 15,
and 9, 24; and 7, 31; and 8, 39; and 8
more, 47: in 47 there is 5 times 9, as 9
times 5 make 45; there remains 2, therefore
in order to complete 9, 7 are to be added;
consequently the sum to be multiplied will
be 7,897,887.</p>

<p>Then give this sum, which has been increased
by a 7, to the person who has presented
it to you: and tell him to chuse whatever
multiplier he pleases; then retire while
he does the multiplication, recommending
him to strike out the figure he pleases, as
usual, and to set down on a piece of paper the
remaining sum, the figure being defalcated,
and the remaining figures ranged as he pleases;
and in order to guess the number that was
struck out, you are to proceed as it has been
explained for the first manner of operating,
and with the same tricks.</p>

melting will leave the spring at liberty to extend

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
